# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Check WHERE You Set VITE_API_URL

## üîç Quick Check

**Look at the URL in your browser when you set VITE_API_URL:**

### ‚úÖ If you see:
```
https://vercel.com/dashboard
https://dashboard.vercel.com
https://vercel.com/dashboard/[your-project]/settings/environment-variables
```
**GOOD!** ‚úÖ You're in Vercel (frontend) - this is correct.

---

### ‚ùå If you see:
```
https://dashboard.render.com
https://app.render.com
https://render.com/web/[your-service]/environment-variables
```
**WRONG!** ‚ùå You're in Render (backend) - Move to Vercel!

---

## üéØ The Problem

**`VITE_API_URL` needs to be in VERCEL (frontend)**, NOT Render!

### Why?
- `VITE_*` variables are for frontend builds (Vite)
- Vercel builds your frontend and reads `VITE_API_URL` during build
- Render is your backend, it doesn't need `VITE_API_URL`

---

## ‚úÖ What Each Platform Needs

### Vercel (Frontend) - `mauricios-cafe-bakery.vercel.app`
**Needs:**
```
VITE_API_URL=https://mauricios-cafe-bakery.onrender.com
```
‚úÖ This makes your frontend API calls go to the backend

### Render (Backend) - `mauricios-cafe-bakery.onrender.com`
**Needs:**
```
FRONTEND_URL=https://mauricios-cafe-bakery.vercel.app
SESSION_SECRET=...
EMAIL_USER=...
EMAIL_PASS=...
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=...
MYSQL_DATABASE=...
```
‚úÖ All your Render variables look correct already

---

## üîß If You Set It in Render Instead of Vercel

### Go to Vercel and set it there:

1. **Open:** https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Click your project:** "Mauricios-Cafe-Bakery"
3. **Click:** Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
4. **Click:** Add New
5. **Add:**
   - Name: `VITE_API_URL`
   - Value: `https://mauricios-cafe-bakery.onrender.com`
   - Apply to: All Environments
   - Save

---

## üéØ How to Know You're in the Right Place

### Vercel Environment Variables Page Shows:
- ‚úÖ URL contains "vercel.com"
- ‚úÖ Shows your frontend deployment
- ‚úÖ Has variables starting with `VITE_*` (frontend variables)

### If You're in Render:
- ‚ùå URL contains "render.com" or "dashboard.render.com"
- ‚ùå Shows your backend service
- ‚ùå Has backend variables like `FRONTEND_URL`, `SESSION_SECRET`, etc.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

**Your screenshot shows you're in Render**, but **`VITE_API_URL` needs to be in Vercel!**

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard (vercel.com)
2. Add `VITE_API_URL` there
3. NOT in Render!
