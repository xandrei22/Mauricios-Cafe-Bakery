# Login Fix Summary

## Issue
Both admin and staff login endpoints were returning 500 errors with HTML error pages instead of JSON responses.

## Root Causes

### 1. Missing JSON Body Parsing Middleware
The `server.js` file was missing `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()` middleware, which are essential for parsing incoming JSON request bodies.

### 2. Field Name Mismatch (Admin Only)
The admin login form was sending `usernameOrEmail` but the backend expected `username`.

## Fixes Applied

### ✅ 1. Added JSON Parsing Middleware
**File:** `capstone/backend/server.js` (Line 147-148)

```javascript
// Parse JSON and URL-encoded request bodies
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
```

**Why this is needed:**
- Express requires these middleware to parse JSON request bodies
- Without it, `req.body` is `undefined`, causing route handlers to crash
- The server then returns HTML error pages (500) instead of JSON

### ✅ 2. Fixed Admin Login Field Name
**File:** `capstone/frontend/src/components/admin/AdminAuthForm.tsx` (Line 39)

Changed from:
```typescript
body: JSON.stringify({
  usernameOrEmail,  // ❌ Wrong
  password,
}),
```

To:
```typescript
body: JSON.stringify({
  username: usernameOrEmail,  // ✅ Correct
  password,
}),
```

**Why this is needed:**
- Backend expects `username` field (see `adminController.js` line 39)
- Staff login was already correct

## What Happens Now

### Before Fix:
1. Frontend sends JSON request
2. Backend can't parse JSON (missing middleware)
3. `req.body` is `undefined`
4. Route handler crashes
5. Server returns HTML 500 error page
6. Frontend tries to parse HTML as JSON
7. **Error:** `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON`

### After Fix:
1. Frontend sends JSON request
2. Backend parses JSON successfully
3. Route handler receives `req.body` correctly
4. Authentication logic works
5. Server returns JSON response
6. Frontend parses JSON successfully
7. **Success:** User is logged in

## Deployment Required

**⚠️ Important:** These changes require the backend to be redeployed to Render/Railway.

The backend will automatically restart on deployment and the new middleware will be active.

## Testing

After deployment, test both login forms:

### Admin Login
- Visit: https://mauricios-cafe-bakery.vercel.app/admin/login
- Use admin credentials
- Should log in successfully

### Staff Login
- Visit: https://mauricios-cafe-bakery.vercel.app/staff/login
- Use staff credentials
- Should log in successfully

## Console Errors Resolved

Before:
- ❌ `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON`
- ❌ `500 Internal Server Error`
- ❌ `Failed to load resource`

After:
- ✅ Success response with user data
- ✅ Session cookie set
- ✅ Redirect to dashboard
